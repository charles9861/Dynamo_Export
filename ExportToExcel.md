# Exporting Data to Excel using Custom Python Node

Before diving in, lets restate our goal to ensure we‚Äôre on the same page:

### üéØ Objective

To:

1. **Extract all available part sizes** from a **Civil 3D Pipe Network**,
   not just the ones already in use.
2. Use that list to **create a pick list** (so you can select a replacement size per pipe).
3. Eventually, **batch-swap parts** (e.g., replace multiple pipes with different sizes at once).

Right now, you‚Äôre stuck at step 1 ‚Äî **getting all possible part sizes** from the Civil 3D parts catalog or the current parts list.

---

### üîç Key Clarification

Could you confirm **which source** you want to pull the part sizes from?

There are two possibilities:

1. **Civil 3D Parts Catalog** (the full library ‚Äî e.g. XML-based structure in `C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\C3D <version>\enu\Pipes Catalog\US Imperial Pipes\...`)

   * This contains *every* available size/type combination.
   * More complex to extract directly ‚Äî would require reading the catalog XMLs.

2. **The Current Drawing‚Äôs Parts List** (the one associated with your network)

   * This is much more accessible via Dynamo.
   * It contains only parts that are available *for use in that drawing*, not the full catalog.

If your goal is to make a practical **size picker for swapping parts**, the **Parts List** route is more manageable.

---

### üß† Likely Dynamo Limitation

By default, **Dynamo for Civil 3D** doesn‚Äôt expose nodes that list all part sizes from a catalog or parts list directly ‚Äî you usually get:

* Pipe/Structure objects in the model (with current size info), or
* Limited access to parts list definitions.

You might need to use:

* **Python nodes** accessing the **Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices** API.
* Specifically, classes like:

  * `Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.PartsList`
  * `Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.PartSize`
  * `Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.PartFamily`
  * `Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.PipeNetwork`

---

### ‚úÖ What I Can Help You With Next

Here‚Äôs what I can do for you now:

1. **Review your Dynamo script** and identify how you‚Äôre currently trying to export the pipe data.
2. **Provide a Python node snippet** you can add to your Dynamo script that:

   * Reads the **Parts List** from Civil 3D.
   * Extracts **all part sizes** for each pipe family.
   * Outputs a list that you can export to Excel or use as a pick list in Dynamo.

---

# Part 2

* **Inspect your `.dyn` script** and explain what‚Äôs missing / where to plug in the Python node,
  or
* **Jump straight to generating a working Python node** that lists all pipe sizes from the parts list?

(Once you pick, I‚Äôll open and analyze the `.dyn` file or generate the Python code.)

Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly the right approach üëå
We‚Äôll start simple and build it up piece by piece so it‚Äôs easy to troubleshoot and expand later.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do next:

1. **Open your Dynamo script** (`PipeNetworkExportToExcel_V2.dyn`) to see your current structure ‚Äî how data flows, where we can slot in a Python node cleanly, and what outputs you already have.
2. Then I‚Äôll write a **Python node** that:

   * Runs inside Dynamo for Civil 3D,
   * Reads the **current Parts List** attached to your active drawing,
   * Extracts **all pipe sizes** (diameters, names, etc.),
   * Outputs them as a list of strings or dictionaries (so you can later export or link them to dropdowns).

Once that works, we can expand it to include things like material, structure type, or even automate the part swapping.

---

Let‚Äôs start by inspecting your `.dyn` file.
Give me a moment to read it and see where we‚Äôll integrate the Python node.


Your Dynamo script looks well-developed ‚Äî it currently has:

* **25 Function nodes** (custom or built-in operations)
* **16 Number input nodes**
* **5 String input nodes**
* **1 Extension node** (likely for Excel or Civil 3D integration)
* **58 connectors** linking everything

This suggests you‚Äôre already exporting or processing pipe data systematically (probably through Civil 3D > Excel).

---

### üß© Next Step ‚Äî Add the Custom Python Node

We‚Äôll insert a **Python Script node** that:

* Queries the **active Civil 3D document**,
* Gets the **current Parts List**,
* Extracts **pipe part sizes**,
* Returns them as a list (ready for Excel export or pick list use).

Here‚Äôs a minimal version to start with:

```python
# Python Script for Dynamo (Civil 3D)
# Get available pipe part sizes from the current parts list

import clr
clr.AddReference('AcMgd')
clr.AddReference('AcDbMgd')
clr.AddReference('AeccDbMgd')

from Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices import Application
from Autodesk.Civil.ApplicationServices import CivilApplication
from Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices import *

doc = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument
civilDoc = CivilApplication.ActiveDocument

output = []

try:
    # Loop through all Parts Lists in the current drawing
    for partsListId in civilDoc.Styles.PartLists:
        partsList = doc.Database.TransactionManager.GetObject(partsListId, 0)
        name = partsList.Name
        pipe_families = []

        # Get each part family (e.g. "Concrete Pipe", "HDPE", etc.)
        for familyId in partsList.GetPartFamilies(PartType.Pipe):
            family = doc.Database.TransactionManager.GetObject(familyId, 0)
            family_name = family.Name
            sizes = []

            # Get all part sizes in this family
            for size in family.PartSizes:
                sizes.append(size.Name)

            pipe_families.append({
                "Family": family_name,
                "Sizes": sizes
            })

        output.append({
            "PartsList": name,
            "PipeFamilies": pipe_families
        })

except Exception as e:
    output = str(e)

OUT = output
```

---

### üß† How to Use This

1. In Dynamo, add a **Python Script** node.
2. Copy‚Äìpaste the code above into it.
3. Run it inside a Civil 3D environment (not Sandbox mode).
4. The output should be a nested list/dictionary of:

   * Parts list name ‚Üí Pipe family ‚Üí Size names.

Example output:

```
[
  {
    "PartsList": "Storm Sewer",
    "PipeFamilies": [
      {"Family": "Concrete Pipe", "Sizes": ["300mm", "375mm", "450mm"]},
      {"Family": "HDPE Pipe", "Sizes": ["150mm", "200mm"]}
    ]
  }
]
```

# **Part 2**

Code above didnt export the expected data

Excellent ‚Äî that‚Äôs very useful feedback ‚úÖ

What you‚Äôre seeing tells me *exactly* what‚Äôs happening under the hood:
the **`.Name`** property I used is returning the *raw XML parameters* of the part definition ‚Äî i.e. Civil 3D‚Äôs internal *part size record string* (`{MCR:0,WTh:150,Material:Reinforced Concrete,‚Ä¶}`), rather than the **user-friendly ‚ÄúNominal Size‚Äù label** that you see in Civil 3D‚Äôs Parts List (‚ÄúConcrete Box Culvert SI‚Äù, ‚Äú1 X 160mm‚Äù, etc.).

That‚Äôs a common trap ‚Äî the *part size record* holds engineering parameters, but not the display name shown in the Toolspace.

---

### üß† What You Actually Want

You want the **display name** of each pipe size, the same text visible in:

> Toolspace ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Parts Lists ‚Üí Pipe ‚Üí [Part Family] ‚Üí [Part Size]

That name is stored in the **PartSizeName** property, not in `.Name` or `.ToString()`.

So, we‚Äôll fix that.

---

### ‚úÖ Revised Python Node (returns Civil 3D Display Names)

This version queries the *PartSizeName* property instead of the internal record string.

```python
# Load the Python Standard and DesignScript Libraries
import sys
import clr

# Add Assemblies for AutoCAD and Civil3D
clr.AddReference('AcMgd')
clr.AddReference('AcCoreMgd')
clr.AddReference('AcDbMgd')
clr.AddReference('AecBaseMgd')
clr.AddReference('AecPropDataMgd')
clr.AddReference('AeccDbMgd')

# Import references from AutoCAD
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.EditorInput import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry import *

# Import references from Civil3D
from Autodesk.Civil.ApplicationServices import *
from Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices import *

# The inputs to this node will be stored as a list in the IN variables.
dataEnteringNode = IN

adoc = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument
editor = adoc.Editor
civilDoc = CivilApplication.ActiveDocument

output = []

with adoc.LockDocument():
    db = adoc.Database
    tm = db.TransactionManager
    with tm.StartTransaction() as t:
        try:
            # Iterate through all Parts Lists in the current drawing
            for partsListId in civilDoc.Styles.PartLists:
                partsList = t.GetObject(partsListId, OpenMode.ForRead)
                list_name = partsList.Name
                pipe_families = []

                # Get each pipe family within the Parts List
                for familyId in partsList.GetPartFamilies(PartType.Pipe):
                    family = t.GetObject(familyId, OpenMode.ForRead)
                    fam_name = family.Name
                    sizes = []

                    # Get all part sizes in this family, using display names
                    for partSize in family.PartSizes:
                        try:
                            # Try to get the user-friendly display name
                            size_name = partSize.PartSizeName
                        except:
                            # Fallback to .Name if property missing
                            size_name = partSize.Name
                        sizes.append(size_name)

                    pipe_families.append({
                        "Family": fam_name,
                        "Sizes": sizes
                    })

                output.append({
                    "PartsList": list_name,
                    "PipeFamilies": pipe_families
                })

        except Exception as e:
            output = str(e)

        t.Commit()

# Assign your output to the OUT variable.
OUT = output
```

---

### üß© What This Will Output

You should now see human-readable part size names like:

```
[
  {
    "PartsList": "Storm and Foul Drainage",
    "PipeFamilies": [
      {"Family": "Concrete Box Culvert SI", "Sizes": ["1 x 160mm", "2 x 300mm", "3 x 450mm"]},
      {"Family": "CG Telecom Ducting", "Sizes": ["1 X 160mm", "3 X 110mm"]}
    ]
  }
]
```

---

### üîç Next Step (Optional)

If this returns the expected, readable data, we can:

* Flatten it for Excel export (`["1 x 160mm", "2 x 300mm", ‚Ä¶]`), or
* Filter it for a specific Parts List or Family so you can target your swaps.

Would you like me to make it **output only the part sizes** (a flat list for pick lists), once we confirm this version works?
